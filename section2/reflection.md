## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between? *I think that to wait to long, but hoping to change that.*

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
Its a statement that gives options if one isnt correct it goes to the next one.
+ If I have three more than 20 dollars I can go out to eat, if I have less I cannot.
+ If my wife is happy, then I am happy, if she isnt I am not. ;)
+ If my son is tired, he will be cranky, if he isnt he may still be cranky.
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
+ To allow multiple answers/choices for the user.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
+ if x <= y
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
+ elsif and else
1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
if x <= y
elsif y = z
else z >= a
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
to send data down the correct path
### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
+ mini script or a code within a code
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello(name)
  puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end

name = "Sam"

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
See above
1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby? A lot! I feel like I was just going through the motions of the lessons, while I think I could utilize it to some extent it would really help to have someone with experience walk me through it and explain it in laymens terms. I may need to study up Vocab as well so when going through the lessons I am truly understanding.
