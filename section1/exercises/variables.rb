# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Seth Perna"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts "Where is #{house_elf}?"

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
harry = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts! said #{house_elf}."
puts "I dont belong here #{house_elf}!"
puts "#{harry}"

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
puts "There are 22 students enrolled if two more enroll."
puts "There will be #{students + 2} students."
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
puts "There are 22 students enrolled if two drop out."
puts "There will be #{students - 2} students."
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Jacey"
is_hungry = "is hungry"
number_of_pets = "2"
puts "#{first_name} #{is_hungry}, but so are her #{number_of_pets} dogs, they come first."

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain. I'm not sure I understand the question I just went off what is in my life and made data types for each and a code to print it accordingly.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "John"
is_hungry = "isnt very hungry"
number_of_pets = ",so he will eat a piece of cheese."
puts "#{first_name} #{is_hungry}#{number_of_pets}"

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
puts "#{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}"

#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
